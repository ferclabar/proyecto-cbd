## Info

This is the docker image with a Jupyter notebook using the GraphFrames.
It contains two notebooks: `blockchain.ipynb` and `graphframes.ipynb`.

### Building

```bash
make build
```
This will build a docker image with the notebook and the example data. It assumes
the parquet data generated by the converter. Check the `buildImg.sh` for example.
Some example data can be found in `../parquet-converter/data/example1/output/`, but
I suggest creating own from the `~/.bitcoin/blocks/blk00xyz.dat` files using the
`parquet-converter`.

### Running

```bash
make open run
```

Then the notebook is listening on http://localhost:8888.
